# Akan Name Generator

## 📘 Project Description
The Akan Name Generator is a web-based application designed to calculate the day of the week a user was born and assign them a traditional Akan name based on their gender. Akan names are culturally significant in Ghanaian tradition, where children are often named after the day of the week they are born.

This project helps users:

- Discover their traditional Akan name
- Learn the corresponding day of the week they were born
- Understand a slice of Ghanaian cultural heritage

The application was built as part of a programming assignment focused on applying foundational web development concepts.
